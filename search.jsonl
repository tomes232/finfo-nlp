{"text": "eCommerce Platform Pepper Raises $16M in Series A Funding to Enhance Ordering Experience for Food Distributors. NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pepper, the eCommerce platform for food distributors, has raised $16 million in Series A funding that will enhance the ordering experience for distributors servicing over 25,000 restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S. and Canada. Index Ventures led the round with participation from Greylock, Imaginary Ventures, BoxGroup, Moving Capital, and Brett Schulman, bringing the total capital raised to date to $20M.With the Series A secured, platform enhancements are a top priority for Pepper. \u201cThis funding enables us to accelerate product development in key areas such as digital payments and a product recommendation engine to grow sales,\u201d says Bowie Cheung, co-founder and CEO. \u201cOur existing clients have been asking for these features, and we're excited to be able to create even more value for them.\u201dCheung and co-founders Chetan Narain and Ivana Tesanovic have a shared passion about food and its importance as a fundamental global industry. Narain and Cheung met at UberEats, where they observed how quickly technology became a fixture in the average restaurant, and in contrast, how absent that same technology was in the day-to-day workflows of food distributors who work with restaurants everyday.That insight led to the founding of Pepper and the launch of its first tools for NYC restaurants and suppliers in early 2020. Today, it\u2019s evolved into a full service online ordering catalogue and payment system that takes advantage of the technology we use in our daily lives.When restaurants and grocery stores order food from their distributors, 80% of the time they leave that order on a voicemail, with no paper trail, accessible order history, or ability to double-check after the fact. And 80% of payments are made to distributors by mailed-in paper checks\u2014many distributors have drawers of uncashed checks to prove it. Pepper recognized where miscommunications happened, money was lost, and food was being wasted.Because the platform is tailor-made for food distributors, it has the ability to support catalogs with over 100,000 items for distributors in every category from dairy, to fish, to produce, and packaging. It enables businesses of all sizes to launch mobile apps and websites that make ordering online a real business growth engine, and provides flexible payment options that fit in any model.The easier it is for venues to order from a distributor, the more they\u2019re willing to spend. Pepper\u2019s data even shows that when their suppliers migrate customers from offline to online, the average revenue with that existing customer goes up 15%. Eliminating reliance on voicemail orders makes ordering more accurate and eases the workload for supplier staff, too.Helping distributors grow and streamline their business is at the core of what Pepper aims to do. \u201cWhen our partners have ideas on the best way to grow their business, we want to explore that with them,\u201d says Cheung. \u201cWe want to put those tools at their fingertips.\u201dThis Series A will be the next step in bringing those desires to life for the platform\u2019s users. \u201cPepper is pursuing what we think is the next big opportunity in the restaurant industry: enabling restaurants to purchase $200B of annual food inventory digitally instead of via phone and email,\u201d says Damir Becirovic, Principal at Index Ventures, and Pepper investor. \u201cPepper has built a great platform that they provide to food distributors, essentially enabling a Shopify-like eCommerce storefront for them.\u201dAnd enabling suppliers to better do what they do best is why Pepper was founded in the first place. \u201cEveryday we get to work with leaders in the food supply chain who have built incredible businesses from the ground up and navigated industry highs and lows for decades,\u201d says Cheung. \u201cAs we come out of the pandemic, it's a privilege to partner with them by providing the tools that will unlock the next wave of growth and prosperity for their businesses.\u201dAbout Pepper \u2014 Pepper is the eCommerce platform for food distributors. Our clients across the US, Canada, and Mexico use Pepper to power their eCommerce experience for thousands of restaurants, grocery stores, and convenience stores.

{"text": "8 disappointing investor archetypes: How founders can stop falling for them. Lak AnanthContributorShare on Twitter \t\tLak Ananth is founding CEO and managing partner of the global venture capital firm Next47 and serves on the board of several companies that he has helped to grow beyond $1 billion valuations.\tI recently wrote a piece discussing how all capital is not created equal and we are living in a period of super-abundant funding \u2014 in many ways, the best times ever for founders.In this environment, every investor has a well-honed pitch on how they can uniquely add value. Being a founder of a high-growth startup means that you will encounter many situations you never have before, so choosing an investor who will be a partner in building the business is a key decision. In this context, promises of exclusive value-add resonate deeply.Surprisingly, most founders find that the actual value they receive from investors is not always as promised. I have had the opportunity to work with amazing investors who build great thought partnerships with their founders, who are invaluable in making the decisions that change the trajectories of companies and have superpowers in attracting talent.Venture investing is an apprenticeship business, and I am humbled whenever I get a chance to learn from a great investor. However, when I speak to founders, it\u2019s more likely that the investors they picked exhibited a variety of post-funding archetype behaviors, all of which detract from value, not add to it.In the spirit of helping founders look beyond the promises of value, let\u2019s delve into some common archetypes of investor relationships that founders experience post-investment. I hope that both founders and investors will read through these archetypes with a sense of humor. Like a good episode of \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d there is some exaggeration here for effect, but not much!8 disappointing investor archetypesThe narcissist. Narcissists are completely full of themselves, and everything is always about them \u2014 how great their firm is and how great they are. They\u2019re so enamored with themselves that they never take time to understand what founders really want or need. Some narcissists may be well past their glory days \u2014 just figureheads riding on their former successes \u2014 and they\u2019re not going to add value to your startup.The child with a hammer. This is the investor who tells you to follow their advice because, \u201cWe used to do this when I was at Google,\u201d or, \u201cWhen I was on Airbnb\u2019s board, we did this.\u201d They have a hammer, and every problem they see looks like the same nail to be pounded in \u2014 in the same way they did it in the one significant experience they previously had in their professional career. They lack the perspective that there could be 10 other ways to approach and solve the problem. Some investors also have a \u201cfire the executive\u201d hammer that can be particularly destructive.The know-it-all. This is the investor in meetings who doesn\u2019t want to hear anyone else\u2019s opinions, including the founders\u2019. \u201cI invested in Facebook before their Series C, therefore I have all the answers.\u201d They don\u2019t respect founders or their fellow board members, which is damaging to vital relationships and board dynamics. They may also have silver bullets like \u201cOKR\u201d or \u201crecurring revenue\u201d that they are partial to without understanding whether these are a good fit for this business and situation.The lapdog (aka the cheerleader). This is the investor who is never going to deliver the hard message to you \u2014 they\u2019ll always try to be friends with the founders because they want a recommendation to the next company. They\u2019ll pop in to a meeting and invite you out to dinner or on a lavish ski trip. Anytime there\u2019s a difficult situation, however, they fall back on, \u201cWhatever the founder wants is the right answer,\u201d instead of being a thought partner and bringing a valuable perspective.The service router. If you want someone with a fat Rolodex, then you\u2019ve come to the right place with the service router. Need a CFO or a sales manager? The service router will point you to people but never aim for excellence or help a founder figure out what looks good, say, in a new VP of sales. Service routers are good at recirculating among their portfolio companies. The problem is that the talent might have done a fine job at one company but isn\u2019t the right fit for your startup.The Needy Ned. This investor will drive you nuts because they want to be involved in everything your company does, regardless of whether they\u2019re adding value in the process. This might be the first company they\u2019ve been on the board of, or they might be junior in the venture firm. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re dealing with a Needy Ned when they\u2019re surprised and outraged when you haven\u2019t told them every operational detail of your business. A more difficult version of Needy Ned is someone who not just wants to be involved but is trying to grab the wheel out of the founder\u2019s hands and do things their way.The numbers person. For this investor, business is a big, complex spreadsheet, and everything can be reduced to a number or a ratio. They usually come from private equity, investment banking or growth investing, and they typically throw around terms like revenue churn, ARR and \u201cthe magic number.\u201d The trouble is, they don\u2019t understand the story behind the numbers, and they don\u2019t know what it takes to move them.The drive-by. If you want your investor to stay out of your hair after they send some funding your way, then the drive-by is for you. They\u2019re deal machines \u2014 even before your deal is sealed, they\u2019re already on to the next one. By the time two years go by, they have completed 10 other deals and they\u2019re not remotely interested in you as a founder or a company. They might attend a board meeting or two, but when they do, they\u2019ll probably be checking their email to nail down their latest deal.My thoughts for foundersUnfortunately, founders fall for these archetypes every day. As you consider your funding options, here are some things to keep in mind.The person matters way more than the firm. Don\u2019t buy the brand; buy the person. Perform due diligence on the person thoroughly and well. Talk to founders and dig into the references the investor gives you using your own back channels. Make sure there is a personality and style match among you, your co-founders and the existing board. In addition, make sure the investor\u2019s knowledge and prior experience match your business.Make sure both the person and the firm really understand your business. One good way to assess this is how much diligence they do on your product, and whether they personally talk to customers as opposed to reviewing call transcripts done by third parties. If an investor does not take the time to truly understand what you are building before they invest, what are the chances they will understand it after, and, more importantly, be a valuable thought partner?Everyone is a good fair-weather sailor, but when there is a failure or small misstep (which, as I point out in my book, \u201cAnticipate Failure,\u201d will surely happen), the worst behaviors rear their ugly head. Examine how the person behaves when important decisions need to be made or when the going gets tough. One way to test is to ask the investor for references to their worst-performing companies and hear directly how they behaved when things were not going well.Check for evidence of value-add and ask for it in writing in quantifiable ways in the term sheet. If they say they are going to help with hiring, ask them to write down goals for the first two quarters. If they say they can help with customers, ask exactly what amount of revenue they will commit to adding. If they say their brand will attract independent board members, ask to speak to board members they have placed.If you take time to find a good fit with an investor, you will significantly maximize the chances of building something great. Even one bad investor on a board can significantly hurt the chances of your success, and I have unfortunately seen this happen a few times.Don\u2019t be lured by promises, valuations and check sizes \u2014 these are transitory, and the sugar highs from these shiny objects will last for but a short period. Keep your eye on the goal and pick your investor wisely."}

GajiGesa\u2019s earned wage access feature user flowGajiGesa, a fintech company focused on services for Indonesian workers, announced today that it has raised $6.6 million USD in pre-Series A funding. The round was led by MassMutual Ventures, with participation from January Capital, European earned wage access company Wagestream (EWA is GajiGesa\u2019s flagship feature), Bunda Group, Smile Group, Oliver Jung, Northstar Group partners including Patrick Walujo, Nipun Mehra (the CEO of Ula) and Noah Pepper (Stripe\u2019s head of APAC). Returning investors included defy.vc, Quest Ventures, GK Plug and Play and Next Billion Ventures.For a more in-depth look at GajiGesa, take a look at TechCrunch\u2019s profile of the company from February, when it raised its $2.5 million seed round.GajiGesa, a fintech startup serving underbanked Indonesian workers, raises $2.5 million seed roundAgrawal and Malinowska said in a press release that GajiGesa\u2019s team has doubled in size over the past six months to over 50, and the startup plans to use its latest funding on product development, expansion across Indonesia and entering new markets in Southeast Asia.The startup is aimed at unbanked workers and focuses on earned wage access, which lets people withdraw their wages immediately instead of waiting for monthly paychecks, because the founders\u2014husband-and-wife team Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska\u2014said that gives workers much more liquidity and protects them from predatory lenders.GajiGesa now works with more than 120 companies in a wide range of sectors, including factories, plantations, manufacturing, retail, restaurants, hospitals and tech companies. Based on a survey of its clients, GajiGesa claims that over 80% of their employees have stopped using informal lenders because of its EWA feature and 40% are using other financial services through the platform like bill payments and data recharge.The company offers an employer app called GajiTim, which it claims is Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cfirst and largest integrated employee management solution.\u201d By that, it means that employers can manage a wide array of workforce administrative tasks, including part-time and full-time employees and gig workers. The company says GajiTim currently has more than 200,000 users.In a statement about the investment, MassMutual Ventures managing director Anvesh Ramineni said, \u201c[GajiGesa\u2019s] integrated platform combines customer-centric product design and world class technology infrastructure to ensure they are uniquely positioned to empower an chronically underserved market and help expand financial resilience for millions across Southeast Asia.Wagestream closes $51M Series A to plug the payday gap without putting workers in debtWagely, an Indonesian earned wage access and financial services platform, raises $5.6M\u00a0"}

He felt frustrated that authorities would consistently reject patent applications because they were made with parts produced by 3D printers or CNC machines, and therefore, potentially made with the wrong physical structures.\u201cSo I did the Kiwi thing and went to the shed and lucked my way into a system that worked,\u201d he said, noting that much of his experimenting was done using standard microwaves during New Zealand\u2019s latest lockdown, during which time Moodie couldn\u2019t get into his workshop. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to solve is actual castings, trying to simulate a die casting but doing it fast and cheaply.

The company only has a couple of its very large microwaves out for trial with potential customers at the moment, but it will use the Series A funding, which came from Australian VC Blackbird, to get production-ready by the end of 2023.Part of the funding will go toward hiring more staff.

{"text": "Southeast Asia multi-currency neobank YouTrip raises $30M Series A, will launch corporate card. Singapore-based YouTrip, an online bank that focuses on making multi-currency transactions less costly and more efficient, announced today that it has raised a $30 million Series A. YouTrip founder and CEO Caecilia Chu said the round was led by prominent family offices in Asia who prefer to remain unnamed, but are returning from earlier rounds.\u00a0The Series A brings YouTrip\u2019s total funding to more than $60 million. The company says it has now processed over $800 million in card spend globally, with almost 20 million transactions and over 1.5 million app downloads.Chu told TechCrunch that YouTrip decided to raise funding because it\u2019s reaching an \u201cinflection point.\u201d\u00a0\u201cAs Southeast Asia is coming out of the pandemic, and with Singapore really leading the way with the vaccination rate, what we saw on the consumer front is a huge pent-up demand in travel and also the recovery of consumer confidence,\u201d she said. \u201cWe definitely see more spending on e-commerce and in terms of travel, we\u2019ve seen daily transaction volumes grow at least two to three times since the beginning of Singapore\u2019s vaccinated travel lanes.\u201d\u00a0Even though YouTrip is optimistic about those tailwinds, its taking a realistic approach toward the recovery of travel. In the medium-term, Chu said the company is most excited about consumer spending and its new B2B business, which includes a multi-currency corporate card called YouBiz.\u00a0Caecilia Chu, Co-founder and CEO, YouTripOver the next year, YouTrip also plans to focus on geographical expansion. Currently operational in Singapore and Thailand, it has partnered with Visa to expand into the Philippines and Malaysia. Chu added that the company is also in late-stage discussions with partners to launch in Indonesia and Vietnam.\u00a0When TechCrunch\u00a0last covered YouTrip in 2019, one of core customer bases were international travelers. When COVID hit, the company had to adapt very quickly.\u00a0YouTrip, a challenger bank in Southeast Asia, raises $25.5M for expansionIt added new features like YouTrip Perks, setting up partnership teams to work with merchants like Lazada and Shopee on cashback deals of up to 15%. \u201cDuring the pandemic, people were not only buying much more things online, but also they were more health conscious, so we saw more purchases of sporting equipment and health supplements,\u201d said Chu. \u201cWe\u2019ve been targeting the most relevant merchants for our users, to get those merchants partnerships going.\u201d\u00a0The company says its transaction volume has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. Since it anticipates more traction as consumer spending and travel increases, YouTrip plans to introduce a brand makeover for its consumer app in early 2022, along with new payment features.\u00a0YouBiz, its corporate card, is also slated for launch in early 2022. Chu says one of the reasons the company entered the B2B space was because more SMBs are adopting fintech services.\u00a0\u201cWe know how important it is to be a truly pandemic-resilient company,\u201d she added. \u201cWe promised ourselves that we would no longer read the news every day to see when the borders would reopen. We would make it work and continue to make it work regardless of new travel measures.\u201d\u00a0The company has also witnessed a paradigm shift among SMBS.\u201cThey\u2019re really more open-minded to fintech products, to new banking products,\u201d Chu said. \u201cMore relevant to us, because of the whole working from home and hybrid models, companies are increasingly distributed. Their payroll, vendor payments, even how they receive revenue or how they invoice their consumers is worldwide, and their foreign currency needs are certain to go up, so we feel that it is really the right time to segment into this market.\u201d\u00a0Once YouBiz is launched, YouTrip will be among several Southeast Asia VC-backed fintech companies that offer corporate cards or focus on the SMB space, including Aspire, Spenmo and Volopay. But Chu says the SMB space is not only huge compared to the consumer space, but \u201cthere is a massive opportunity because it is a heavily underserved one.\u201d\u00a0Aspire raises $158M Series B to build a full-stack \u201cfinancial operating system\u201d for Southeast Asian businessesIn particular, YouTrip plans to focus on companies that have between one to 1,000 employees. It picked this segment because YouBiz is not meant to be a replacement for traditional bank accounts. Instead, its main value-add is enabling SMBs to spend less on foreign currency transactions. YouTrip also plans to introduce an expense management tool, with an eye toward business travel picking up again.\u00a0\u201cI feel like on the SMB front, it\u2019s not going to be one winner takes all. But getting back to the competition, we are also going into the space with our eyes wide open,\u201d Chu said. \u201cWe have two key advantages that really stand out. One is that we are the only neobank that owns our entire tech infrastructure and licensing infrastructure end to end.\u201d\u00a0YouTrip invested a lot in its own technology stack \u201cbecause the margin is razor-thin in consumer payment services, so in order to deliver the best cost and value, we need to optimize our value chain to a level where we have full control,\u201d including over its product roadmap.\u00a0YouTrip\u2019s second advantage is that already has strong brand recognition. \u201cWhen we talk to business owners, many are already users of YouTrip for their own purchases,\u201d Chu said. That track record is helping YouTrip as it pitches itself to SMBs and Chu says the company already has 1,000 sign-ups for the launch of its B2B service.\u00a0Insight Partners leads $34M round in Singapore-based fintech Spenmo"}

So where Grammarly helps improve a piece of (existing) writing, by suggesting tweaks to grammar/syntax/style etc., Flowrite helps you write the thing in the first place, so long as the thing is email or some other professional messaging type comms.Email is what Flowrite\u2019s AI models have been trained on, per Isosaari. And frustration with how much time he was having to spend composing emails was the inspiration for the startup. So its focus is firmly professional comms \u2014 rather than broader use cases for AI-generated words, such as copy writing etc (which GPT-3 is also being used for).Grammarly raises $200M at a $13B valuation to make you an even better writer using AI\u201cIn my previous work I knew that this is a problem that I had \u2014 I\u2019d spend several hours every day communicating with different stakeholders on email and other messaging platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also knew that there are a lot more people \u2014 it\u2019s not just our problem as co-founders; there\u2019s millions of people who could benefit from communicating more effectively and efficiently in their day to day work.\u201dHere\u2019s how Flowrite works: The user provides a set of basic (bullet pointed) instructions covering the key points of what they want to say and the AI-powered tool does the rest \u2014 generating a full email text that conveys the required info in a way that, well, flows.Automation is thus doing the wordy leg work of filling in courteous greetings/sign-offs and figuring out appropriate phrasing to convey the sought for tone and impression.Compared to email templates (an existing tech for email productivity), Isosaari says the advantage is the AI-powered tool adapts to context and \u201cisn\u2019t static\u201d.One obvious but important point is that the user does also of course get the chance to check over \u2014 and edit/tweak \u2014 the AI\u2019s suggested text before hitting send so the human remains firmly the agent in the loop.Isosaari gives an example use-case of a sales email where the instructions might boil down to typing something like \u201csounds amazing \u2022 let\u2019s talk more in a call \u2022 next week, Monday PM\u201d \u2014 in order to get a Flowrite-generated email that includes the essential details plus \u201call the greetings\u201d and \u201cadded formalities\u201d the extended email format requires.(Sidenote: Flowrite\u2019s initial pitch to TechCrunch was via email \u2014 but did not apparently involve the use of its tool. At least the email did not include a disclosure that: \u201cThis email is\u00a0Flowritten\u201d as a later missive from Isosaari (to send the PR as requested) did. Which, perhaps, gives an indication of the sorts of email comms you might want to speed-write (with AI) and those you maybe want to dedicated more of your human brain to composing (or at least look like you wrote it all yourself).)\u201cWe\u2019ve built an AI powered writing tools that helps professionals of all kinds to write and communicate faster as part of their daily workflow,\u201d Isosaari tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s millions of people who spend hours every day on emails and messages in a professional context \u2014 so communicating with different stakeholders, internally and externally, takes a lot of work, daily working hours. And Flowrite helps people to do that faster.\u201dThe AI tool could also be a great help to people who find writing difficult for specific reasons such as dyslexia or because English is not their native language, he further suggests.One obvious limitation is that Flowrite is only able to turn out emails in English. And while GPT-3 does have models for some other common languages, Isosaari suggests the quality of its \u2018human-like\u2019 responses there \u201cmight not be as good\u201d as they are in English \u2014 hence he says they\u2019ll remain focused there for now.They\u2019re using GPT-3\u2019s language model as the core AI tech \u2014 but have also, recently, begun to use their own accumulated data to \u201cfine tune it\u201d, with Isosaari noting: \u201cAlready we\u2019ve built a lot of things on top of GPT-3 as opposed to building a wrapper on it.\u201dThe startup\u2019s promise for the email productivity tool is also that the AI will adapt to the user\u2019s writing style \u2014 so that faster emails won\u2019t also mean curtly out of character emails (which could lead to fresh emails asking if you\u2019re okay?).Isosaari says the tech is not not mining your entire email history to do this \u2014 but rather only looks at the directly preceding context in an email thread (if there is one).Flowrite does also currently rely on cloud processing, since it\u2019s calling GPT-3\u2019s tech, but he says they want to move to on-device processing, which would obviously help address any confidentiality concerns, when we ask about that.For now the tool is browser-based and integrates with web email. Currently it only works for Chrome and Gmail but Isosaari confirms the team\u2019s plan is to expand integrations \u2014 such as for messaging platforms like Slack (but still initially at least, only for the web app version).While the tech tool is still in a closed beta, the startup has just announced a $4.4 million seed raise.The seed is led by Project A, along with Moonfire Ventures and angel investors Ilkka Paananen (CEO & Co-founder of Supercell), Sven Ahrens (director of global growth at Spotify), and Johannes Schildt (CEO & Co-Founder of Kry). Existing investors Lifeline Ventures and Seedcamp also joined in the round.What types of emails and professionals is Flowrite best suited for? On the content side, Isosaari says it\u2019s \u201ctypically replies where there\u2019s some kind of existing context that you are responding to\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s able to understand the situation really well and adapt to it in a really natural way,\u201d he suggests. \u201cAnd also for outreaches \u2014 things like pitches and proposals\u2026 What it doesn\u2019t work that well for is if you want to write something that is really, really complex \u2014 because then in order to do that you would need to have all that information in the instructions. And then obviously if you need to spend a lot of time writing the instruction that could be even close to the final email \u2014 and there\u2019s not much value that Flowrite can provide at that point.\u201dIt\u2019s also obviously not going to offer great utility if you\u2019re firing off \u201creally, really short emails\u201d \u2014 since if you\u2019re just answering with a couple of words it\u2019s likely quicker to type that yourself.In terms of who\u2019s likely to use Flowrite, Isosaari says they\u2019ve had a broad range of early adopters seeking to tap into the beta. But he describes the main user profile as \u201cexecutives, managers, entrepreneurs who communicate a lot on a daily basis\u201d \u2014 aka, people who \u201cneed to give a good impression about themselves and communicate very thoughtfully\u201d.On the business model front, Flowrite\u2019s initial focus is on prosumers/individual users \u2014 although Isosaari says it may look to expand out from there, perhaps first supporting teams. And he also says he could envisage some kind of SaaS offering for businesses down the line.Currently, it\u2019s not charging for the beta \u2014 but does plan to add pricing early next year. \u201cOnce we move out of the beta then we\u2019ll be starting to monetize,\u201d he adds, suggesting that a full launch out of beta (so no more waitlist) could happen by mid 2022.\u00a0The seed funding will primarily be spent on growing the team, according to Isosaari, especially on the engineering side \u2014 with the main goal at this early stage being to tool up around AI and core product.Expanding features is another priority \u2014 including adding a \u201chorizontal way\u201d of using the tool across the browser, such as with different email clients.This report was updated to clarify a quotation by Isosaari as he intended to say Flowrite is not just building a wrapper for GPT-3 but rather that it\u2019s building on top of itOkay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable"}

{"text": "Fundbox, a fintech focused on SMBs, raises $100M at a $1.1B valuation. Fundbox, a company that offers loans and financial products to small businesses, announced today it has raised $100 million in a Series D round at a valuation of $1.1 billion.Or more simply, the company aims to solve SMBs\u2019 working capital needs through its credit and payments offerings. It is particularly focused on B2B-focused small businesses.\u201cWe use artificial intelligence to deliver financial products that small business owners use to better run and grow their businesses,\u201d CEO Prashant Fuloria told TechCrunch.Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) led Fundbox\u2019s Series D financing, which brings the company\u2019s total equity raised to $410 million since its 2013 inception. Existing backers Allianz X, Khosla Ventures and The Private Shares Fund joined new investors including Arbor Waypoint Select Fund and a suite of BNY Mellon funds managed by Newton Investment Management North America.San Francisco-based Fundbox last raised in 2019 \u2014 a $175 million Series C that valued the company at $700 million post-money. That same year, the company also opened its Dallas office, now its largest in the U.S., \u201cto capitalize on the talent pool there,\u201d according to Fuloria.Fundbox is refreshingly transparent about its financials, at least when it comes to revenue. The startup, which saw a pandemic-related boost in business, crossed $100 million in annual revenue run rate earlier this year. Today, it is \u201cwell and truly beyond\u201d that, Fuloria said, although it is not yet profitable as it is focused on growth, he said.Since the company launched its first product in 2013, it has \u201cconnected with\u201d over 325,000 small businesses and transacted over $2.5 billion in working capital, the executive added. In 2021, Fundbox tripled its new customer acquisition rate. But the majority of its revenue comes from existing customers, who Fuloria describes as \u201cincredibly loyal.\u201d He believes one of the company\u2019s biggest differentiators \u2014 besides its use of AI and data \u2014 is that it is focused on SMBs whose customers are other businesses, rather than consumers.For example, Fundbox works with SMBs that serve customers like restaurants, such as businesses supplying food or companies supplying cleaning and staffing services to these restaurants.\u201cThese B2B SMBs have the same challenges as everybody else except that they invoice their clients and then they wait to get paid,\u201d Fuloria told TechCrunch. \u201cAll of this capital tied up in unpaid receivables is a huge drag on those SMBs. So one of the things that Fundbox does is provide tools to unlock that working capital that\u2019s tied up in unpaid invoices, which actually adds up to over a trillion dollars in the U.S. alone.\u201d Customers, he added, can receive approval in minutes, with access to capital as soon as the next business day.Khosla led Fundbox\u2019s Series A in 2014 and founding partner and managing director David Weiden said his firm was initially \u2014 and remains \u2014 impressed with Fundbox\u2019s founders\u2019 ability to recognize there were \u201cdramatic increases in the availability of relevant data in the small business market.\u201d\u201cMany companies talk about data and using AI; ironically, only a few have any data that demonstrates the actual effectiveness of their approach,\u201d he wrote via email. \u201cFundbox, including over the exceptional pandemic period, delivered strong results and are on a path to continued growth and scale.\u201dFundbox Secures $50 Million More To Power Small BusinessesThe company\u2019s customers range from sole proprietors with a few dozen employees and as little as a few hundred thousand dollars a year or businesses with as much as a few million dollars a year in annual revenue. Fundbox asks its customers to connect with it via some aspect of their transactional system, such as their invoicing app or even their bank account.\u201cWe look at these business transactions sitting in their systems and put together what we call a business graph where you can imagine the nodes of the graph being all these small businesses that are trading with each other, with the customers being their vendors and the connections being their transactions,\u201d Fuloria explained. \u201cAnd that graph becomes our picture of the small business economy to derive signals or features that can be used to assess the risk of a B2B transaction or a B2B small business.\u201dImage Credits: FundboxThe company then uses those risk assessments to provide tools, such as working capital on tap or the ability to get instant funding against an invoice. It also integrates with other companies\u2019 technology. For example, it\u2019s partnered with Intuit and is natively integrated inside of QuickBooks. It also shows up in places like FreshBooks\u2019 accounting software or in Synchrony\u2019s merchant center (Synchrony is an investor in Fundbox).The small end of the small businesses are often ignored by large banks, Fuloria contends, because the average bank spends over $3,500 (largely in human capital) in assessing a small business\u2019s risk. For loans that aren\u2019t much more than that, it\u2019s not exactly worth it. However, to be clear, Fundbox says it offers up to $150,000 in lines of credit.\u201cOur focus on using AI to make these decisions really helps us shine because more than 99% of all our decisions are completely automated without any human involvement whatsoever,\u201d Fuloria said. \u201cAnd that lets us really scale and serve customers very, very efficiently.\u201dWhile primarily having served as a lender, Fundbox is now expanding into payments and membership-based offerings (with the intent to generate a subscription revenue stream). The company recently launched Flex Pay, which is designed to provide small business owners with additional payment options and greater flexibility for business expenses.For example, Fundbox Line of Credit customers now get three extra days to pay those expenses. Repayment options include a bank account, credit card or Line of Credit draw, essentially providing small business owners with another tool to buy now, pay later, according to Fuloria.Looking ahead, next year Fundbox plans to develop a product aimed specifically at entrepreneurs with multiple small businesses as well as new businesses that lack the financial history to access capital through traditional means.Shrirang Apte, VP of HOOPP, believes Fundbox\u2019s performance this year speaks to the market opportunity \u201cin disrupting the highly underserved world of small business financing, which has traditionally lagged behind consumer financing innovations.\u201dFundbox plans to use its new capital to expand its 300-person team, customer acquisition and expanding its product offerings. It recently hired a handful of new execs, including two former Capital One veterans \u2014 Khary Scott and Shawn Haigh to serve as VP and head of partnerships and VP of growth marketing, respectively."}
{"text": "CloudTrucks raised $115M Series B to help truck entrepreneurs manage their business. CloudTrucks wants to use technology to help trucking entrepreneurs operate their business: The California-based startup sells business management software that helps owner-operators manage cash flow and costs, generate revenue, handle insurance, and more, and it just raised a $115 million Series B.The company will use the funds to increase headcount as it expands its business, which operates in the United States. CloudTrucks is hiring in almost all areas, with a focus on engineers and data scientists to help double down on product, as well as customer service professionals to support truckers on the road. The company also wants to broaden its digital integration with brokers and shippers.\u201cWe cater to owner-operators and truck drivers who have one or more trucks and are managing their business while also doing the job of moving goods from point A to point B,\u201d Tobenna Arodiogbu, co-founder and CEO of CloudTrucks, told TechCrunch. \u201cThe job of being a trucking entrepreneur is getting harder and harder. Lots of tools are being built for brokers and shippers, but not nearly enough is being done for the truck driver who\u2019s actually doing the really hard work.\u201dFreight movement is expected to rise from 17.4 billion tons in 2015 to 25.5 billion tons by 2045, an increase that coincides with a decrease in truck drivers. Since the 1980s, the industry has experienced high turnover rates, in large part due to low wages and the poor health effects associated with the job. Without significant changes to the business model and talent pool, the truck driver shortage is estimated to hit 160,000 drivers by 2028, according to Deloitte.The autonomous trucking space promises to one day alleviate these labor issues, but that shift will take place over decades and likely include integration between humans handling first- and last-mile deliveries and self-driving systems managing highway transport, according to Deloitte. Waymo Via\u2019s transfer hub model is a perfect example of this.Despite future projections of a driverless world, Arodiogbu sees a market need now. There are around 350,000 owner-operator truckers in the United States, according to the nonprofit Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, but Arodiogbu reckons the target market is actually as large as a million truck drivers. Owner-operators usually own one truck and either lease onto a carrier or operate under their own authority, but CloudTrucks also targets entrepreneurs who have up to five trucks, as well as truckers who are contractors.Before founding CloudTrucks, Arodiogbu started Scotty Labs, a startup focused on building remote operations and autonomous driving solutions for the trucking industry, which was later acquired by DoorDash. While running the company, Arodiogbu gained insights into the problems truck drivers had with managing their businesses and why the industry has been attracting fewer drivers, resulting in today\u2019s truck driver shortage. These issues include things like trouble making revenue-generating decisions, the rising costs of insurance and compliance, and how long it takes to get paid.\u201cIt\u2019s not just a job of driving, but it\u2019s everything else that people have to manage,\u201d said Arodiogbu. \u201cAn increasing number of truck drivers just don\u2019t want to be company employees anymore, right? They want to take control of their time. They want to determine when they\u2019re home and when they\u2019re on the road. They want to determine when they get to spend time with their families.\u201dCloudTrucks launched three products over the past year to help solve trucking business challenges. CT Cash helps drivers get paid faster and alleviate cash flow constraints with instant pay and cash card options, as well as cash advances, so drivers don\u2019t have to worry about not having enough funds for fuel or maintenance.Flex, which is designed for small trucking businesses that are already managing their own insurance and compliance, helps with back office support. This product came from an existing product line called Virtual Carrier, which essentially puts drivers under CloudTrucks\u2019 authority. Included in this is a package deal where CloudTrucks manages everything for the driver, including compliance and insurance.Included in both Flex and the Virtual Carrier is a \u201cschedule optimizer\u201d feature, which Arodiogbu described as a dispatcher in your pocket. CloudTrucks has the schedule and preferences for every driver in its system, so it\u2019s able to send suggestions for available loads that can help maximize revenue given preferences and the states they\u2019re willing to drive to. Drivers can book those loads within the platform, which helps simplify the whole process.Then there\u2019s Business Intelligence, a dashboard that gives drivers a breakdown of their performance, personal expenses and revenue.\u201cYou can\u2019t really improve something that you don\u2019t track, so with that in mind, we wanted to have a product that was very simple for a trucking entrepreneur to just look at the CloudTrucks app and, at a glance, see exactly how their business is performing,\u201d said Arodiogbu.As far as how CloudTrucks\u2019 business is performing, the company said its revenue has increased 9.5x since it raised its $20.5 million Series A in December 2020. The startup also said it\u2019s seen the number of loads completed on its platform grow 8x since last year, but declined to provide a base for either of those increases. Arodiogbu did say that the company completes thousands of loads around the country per month.CloudTrucks\u2019 Series B was led by Tiger Global with participation from Menlo Ventures, as well as investment from Flexport and angel investors Michael Ovitz and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu, and brought the startup\u2019s total funding amount to $141.6 million."}
{"text": "Developer productivity tools startup Raycast raises $15M from Accel and Coatue. Developer-focused productivity tool Raycast has raised $15 million in Series A funding, led by Accel and Coatue. Also participating in the round were angel investors Johnny Boufarhat, CEO and founder of Hopin; Jeff Weinstein, product at Stripe; Jason Warner, former CTO of GitHub; and Ott Kaukver, CTO of Checkout.com, among others.Raycast was founded in 2020 by former Facebook software engineers Thomas Paul Mann and Petr Nikolaev, who sought to create a way to recover the time developers lose every day due to continuous context-switching between different SaaS tools.\u201cWe started the company because we wanted to improve how we work with computers,\u201d CEO Mann told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cAs developers ourselves, we find ourselves spending a lot of time on busywork that doesn\u2019t bring that much value. We\u2019d rather spend our time on the work that actually matters. This is the premise of Raycast \u2014 we bring you a tool that helps you get work done faster.\u201dRaycast aims to make it easier for developers to find and update information with its command-line-inspired interface. The platform enables the automation of day-to-day processes and allows developers to focus on important tasks. The desktop software takes a note from peers like Superhuman and Command E, allowing users to quickly pull up and modify data with keyboard shortcuts. Users can easily create and re-modify issues in Jira, merge pull requests in GitHub and find documents. The software is essentially a developer-focused version of Apple\u2019s Spotlight search, which aims to help software engineers navigate all the parts of their job that aren\u2019t development work using a single tool.In terms of growth, Raycast says that in just 12 months, it has increased its daily active user base from 130 in October 2020 to over 11,000 to date, with more than 20 million actions performed on the platform in that time. The team currently consists of 12 members, with more people expected to join by the end of the year.Raycast has also released its Extensions API and Store in public beta, giving developers the ability to build custom extensions and share them with their team or community. The company says that in one month, the community built more than 100 extensions on the beta, connecting to services like Figma, GitHub, Chrome, Notion, YouTube, Twitter and more. Raycast is now publicly launching the Extensions API and Store, opening it up to developers around the world.Image Credits: RaycastAs for the new funding, Mann said Raycast wants to become the leader in developer productivity.\u201cThat\u2019s our goal with the funding. We will use the funding to scale our team further up. We want to make this platform universally accessible to everyone so that they can build the tools they want to have,\u201d he said.Raycast plans to use the funding to build its community of developers and tools, accelerate growth on the platform, and bring Raycast to teams. Although the company will remain heavily focused on individual developers, Raycast sees potential in making it easy to share productivity tools and workflows with others. Starting today, companies will be able to sign up for a program to get access to new team features. Users will be able to create their own internal store, where they can build and distribute custom extensions and links specific to the needs of their teams.\u201cTeams can now build extensions and share them privately with their team members,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIf they have an internal tool that makes themselves more productive with the custom setup they have, they can share that with their team members so they can benefit from it as well. This helps them stay productive as a team and saves them time on the busywork they usually have.\u201dRaycast\u2019s Series A funding follows the company\u2019s $2.7 million seed round from October 2020. The round was\u00a0led by Accel, with participation from YC, Jeff Morris Jr.\u2019s Chapter One fund, as well as angel investors Charlie Cheever, Calvin French-Owen and Manik Gupta.\u201cSince leading Raycast\u2019s seed investment, we\u2019ve been impressed with the growth and traction Raycast has seen in the developer community,\u201d Andrei Brasoveanu, a partner at Accel, said in a statement. \u201cThis backs up our initial belief that Raycast has the potential to become an indispensable tool for developers, and we\u2019re excited to see the team go even further with the launch of the API and Store and expansion to teams.

{"text": "Groundswell Announces A Total of $15M in Seed Funding To Democratize Philanthropy. LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Groundswell, the Philanthropy-as-a-Service platform that\u2019s empowering employees with their own personal donor-advised funds (DAFs), today announced that they have raised a total of $15M in seed investment funding. The round was led by GV (formerly Google Ventures), with participation from Human Ventures, Moonshots Capital, Felicis Ventures, and Core Innovation Capital.Groundswell is revolutionizing how companies think about employee compensation by decentralizing corporate philanthropy and using it to fund personal donor-advised funds for each employee. Like the 401k did for retirement, Groundswell puts employees in the driver's seat of corporate philanthropy and empowers them to create worldwide impact. Employee users are also provided with tools historically reserved for the ultra-rich, including tax-free investment opportunities, customized giving opportunities, frictionless donation options, and centralized impact reporting. The platform aims to become a ubiquitous component of employee benefits packages and charitable giving.As the war for talent heats up, Groundswell will help companies authentically unlock corporate purpose alongside profit by channeling corporate social responsibility efforts through employees. By directly gifting or matching contributions into employee DAFs, companies are empowering their workforce to find the solutions they want to see to the problems they feel are most pressing - a powerful acknowledgement of the diversity of employees\u2019 backgrounds. Additionally, as the shift to remote work accelerates, Groundswell allows workers to be the change in their community - regardless of where that community is. Considering that more Americans give to charity each year than contribute to a 401(k), Groundswell\u2019s approach will provide a financial boost to a significant portion of the workforce.\u201cWe want to create a new category of service that combines the best aspects of HR tech, fintech, and philanthropy,\u201d says Jake Wood, Co-Founder & CEO, who previously led the highly regarded nonprofit Team Rubicon. \u201cOur Philanthropy-as-a-Service approach is democratizing philanthropy for the masses, by enabling them to give better, smarter, easier, and more intentionally. We\u2019re excited to have found investors who understand this vision, and want to work alongside us as we make it a reality.\u201dGroundswell\u2019s platform was formally announced in September 2021 following six months of behind the scenes development in partnership with Human Ventures.

{"text": "Cycode Raises $56M Series B Round to Secure Software Supply Chains. SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cycode, the leader in software supply chain security, today announced a $56M Series B round led by New York-based global private equity and venture capital firm, Insight Partners. YL Ventures, a global VC firm specializing in Israeli cybersecurity investments, who led Cycode\u2019s seed investment, also participated in the round. The funding, one of the largest Series B rounds ever in Application Security (AppSec), comes on the heels of Cycode\u2019s $20 million Series A funding in May of 2021. This round brings the total investment to $81 million.Cycode has capitalized on the convergence of several technology trends to achieve explosive growth. Since it first began selling in 2020, the company has acquired dozens of customers, ranging from large Fortune 500 enterprises to rapidly growing startups. Moreover, in just the first three quarters of 2021 Cycode increased ARR 7x.As software engineering and DevOps teams have adopted new tools, the tools themselves have become attack surfaces. While, in previous eras AppSec teams secured development tools, today, they are rarely responsible for doing so. In a survey of 176 technology executives, fewer than 22% of organizations have AppSec teams responsible for securing these key development tools and processes.Which team is responsible for securing the following development tools?:Source Control Management (e.g. GitHub) = 21% AppSecBuild Tools (e.g. Jenkins) = 16% AppSecInfrastructure-as-Code (e.g. Kubernetes) = 13% AppSecContainers (e.g. Docker) = 12% AppSecCloud providers (e.g. AWS) = 21% AppSecWhile DevOps automation drives efficiency in the software development life cycle (SDLC), the interconnectedness also facilitates lateral movement between tools, systems, and resources across the software supply chain.Source control management systems (SCM) are becoming the hub of many organizations\u2019 SDLC. \u201cIn order to truly shift left, security teams need to put as much emphasis on securing the development environment as they do production,\u201d said Kevin Paige, CISO at Flexport. \u201cFrom the SCM, attackers have access to source code, they can modify CI/CD settings, tamper with code, steal credentials, provision vulnerable cloud infrastructure, and more.\u201dThe frequency and severity of software supply chain attacks are increasing significantly. According to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, supply chain attacks are expected to increase 400% from 2020 to 2021. Furthermore, Gartner predicts by 2025, 45% of organizations worldwide will have experienced attacks on their software supply chains, a three-fold increase from 2021.Cycode addresses software supply chain security with a platform that provides visibility, security, and integrity across all phases of the SDLC. Through integrations with DevOps tools and infrastructure, Cycode hardens security postures and implements consistent governance policies. Risk of software supply chain breach is further reduced by scanning for hardcoded secrets, infrastructure as code misconfigurations, code leaks, improper access, and more. Cycode\u2019s knowledge graph then creates a comprehensive mapping of the software supply chain\u2014including security violations, user activity, and other events across the SDLC\u2014to prioritize risk, find anomalies, and prevent code tampering.\u201cWhile development tools have never been more integrated, prior to Cycode, relevant DevOps security data remained siloed and inaccessible to most AppSec teams. The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the modern SDLC means that we can no longer ignore seemingly innocuous data as harmless,\u201d said James Robinson, Deputy CISO at Netskope. \u201cSecurity teams need tools that plug in to their processes and understand how events and user behaviors relate to each other across each phase of the SDLC. Cycode\u2019s knowledge graph delivers contextual insight to prioritize risk and gets more powerful with each new tool we plug into it.\u201dEqually important to solving real customer pain points has been Cycode\u2019s ease-of-deployment and rapid time-to-value. Fewer and fewer organizations have tolerance for long deployments with heavy professional services build-outs. In sharp contrast, Cycode typically installs in minutes and delivers immediate visibility across customers\u2019 entire SDLC.\u201cCycode\u2019s pre-built network of integrations made onboarding a snap,\u201d said Joshua Danielson, CISO of Copart. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for an enterprise of our size to onboard new vendors quickly and seamlessly. However, Cycode flawlessly connected to all of our key tools and delivered immediate value.\u201d\u201cSimply put, software supply chains are highly vulnerable, absent, thoughtful security measures,\u201d said Jon Rosenbaum, principal at Insight Partners. \u201cCycode\u2019s leadership in securing DevOps pipelines meets developers where they are while giving CISOs peace of mind. There has been a continually increasing demand for Cycode\u2019s solutions, and we\u2019re excited to continue to support the business as it doubles down on R&D and go-to-market efforts into the ScaleUp phase of growth.\u201dCycode intends to use the funds to fuel sales growth and accelerate development of its product roadmap. Cycode is expanding its go-to-market capabilities by building a partner-friendly ecosystem of both channel and technology alliances. Engineering will focus on expanding Cycode\u2019s pre-built integration network to include 3rd party security tools, deepening user behavior analytics and anomaly detection capabilities and continuing to enhance its knowledge graph to enable deep investigation of breach paths through an interactive link analysis-based interface.\u201cThe key to modern AppSec is centralizing and mapping events and metadata across the SDLC such that it becomes easy to determine when disparate activities add meaningful context to each other,\u201d said Lior Levy, co-founder & CEO of Cycode. \u201cWith each new integration, our knowledge graph becomes smarter. Hence, one of our goals is to integrate with every software delivery and AppSec tool to determine how each dot is connected and when it\u2019s relevant.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so exciting about this company is the comprehensiveness of its vision for SDLC security,\u201d said John Brennan, Partner at YL Ventures. \u201cFrom day one, Cycode\u2019s approach has supported a vision that surpasses anything that currently exists in the space, making it one of the fastest growing AppSec companies in the industry. This is the kind of platform solution that CISOs envision when aiming to solve big problems with robust solutions.\u201dAbout CycodeCycode is a complete software supply chain security solution that provides visibility, security, and integrity across all phases of the SDLC. Cycode integrates with DevOps tools and infrastructure providers, hardens their security postures by implementing consistent governance, and reduces the risk of breaches with a series of scanning engines that look for issues like hardcoded secrets, infrastructure as code misconfigurations, code leaks and more.
